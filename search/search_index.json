These layouts offer different advantages and cater to different tastes. There is also the question of how important same finger is when it involves the stronger index and middle fingers and how much weight to assign to it. Here, some layouts sacrifice a little efficiency in letter placement to achieve better overall results.

Better alternations , Minimal jumps , Minimal outward adjacent fingers (excluding Index finger) Minimal same_finger_rp (excluding Index and Middle fingers) combined jumps , same_finger_rp and same_finger_im , combined jumps , outward , same_finger_rp and same_finger_im , kilo score is not very important since it depends on weights used and configuration values, but can be used as a rough indication, Extra features Changes the placement of the shift keys, allowing the use of the thumbs to shift instead of the pinkies. This is not a part of the optimization stats, but if you try it and don't like it you can always use the regular shift keys. Uses shift keys for level 3/4 to make it easier to use these levels.
